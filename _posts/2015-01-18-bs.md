I am quite aware I havent posted in a while. This past year has been taken up with --- er well work, and outside of work has been a lot of tangible creative stuff (e.g. sewing) rather than digital. Which is an explanation but not an excuse... 

That aside, here is an offering: a list of the best bullshit generators I've found on the web. (Sometimes it comes in handy to have a page that lists them, rather than linking direct!) Feel free to contact me with suggestions if I've left any new/important ones off the list.
