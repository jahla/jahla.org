title:  "Limecrime: a security awareness good news story?"

Two related things happened today. The first one was utterly unsurprising: a conversation showed that people who really should be concerned had no idea it was a bad idea to use airport phone or laptop chargers. 

Ok. Fine. We all know that most people, especially people who have spent their lives getting to positions of influence rather than reading forums and watching youtube (and perhaps in proportion to that tendency) know less about device security than we may hope, given their positions and our relative forum-, youtube- and irc-engendered wisdom.

But the second thing I learned was a pleasant surprise. 

Security awareness is spreading to some internet sub-communities that one does not normally associate with such topics. A few months ago, it turns out, the makeup brand [Lime Crime got hacked](http://jezebel.com/lime-crimes-website-is-hacked-customer-information-sto-1686744501) --- and dealt with it spectacularly badly, or so public reaction in the makeup community goes. 

Now just stop for a minute. Yes, you, the 15-40 yr old white male who has the skills to work in some vaguely tech related industry. And ok, I realise I tick all those boxes bar 'male' too. You can extrapolate that argument whichever way you will, because you will anyway, so I won't bore you with the details. The point is I've reminded you of context here.

Back to the story.

Lime Crime is a brand known by geeks of makeup, goths, vegans and general makeup inquisitives worldwide. They lost their customers' credit card data and a lot of people lost a fair chunk of money.

And then there was uproar and bad press. Sure, other factors purportedly contribute, but the security breach was the catalyst, and influential bloggers and articles are turning against the brand. To the extent that makeup aficionados are calling it the â€˜Lime Crime scandal'.

The backstory to this deserves mention. There has been controversy surrounding the brand for a number of years, and the Tumblr [Lime Crime Uncensored](http://limecrimeuncensored.tumblr.com/) was started back in 2013 as "a response to the aggressive and thorough purging Lime Crime engage in to keep any issues regarding their company from being discussed on the Internet." This is just one of the anti-Lime Crime blogs around, it seems.

Still, it was this security breach that brought the company to wider attention. Does this mean that the security of customer data is really becoming important for mainstream retailers? I would very much like to think so.
