So a few weeks ago I presented at [TEDxCanberra] (http://tedxcanberra.org/) [Salon 2013](http://conferences.tedxcanberra.org/tedxcanberrasalon2013/). It was a great experience and a massive learning curve, it really made me think. It was an opportunity to synthesise my ideas on life, philosophy, climate, and my experiences — into the one 18-minute talk.

How did it go? Well, here is the video of my talk… Make up your own mind (:
