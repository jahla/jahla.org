Sometimes iTunes can be frustrating, especially if you have large amounts of music to sort through and possibly trash. Personally, I like to do this while working on something else, so I don't want to have to go through the whole process of sorting and deleting manually.

Like (I assume) many DJs and music lovers, I have a lot of music. But I don't want to have to stop, go to iTunes, skip through the offending song to check it doesn't get better, ctrl+click Show in Finder, cmd+del, cmd-tab iTunes, ctrl+click Show in Playlist> Music, delete from iTunes libraryâ€¦

Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to do all this from a hotkey from any application? A way that didn't require any other input, so you didn't have to pause what you were doing elsewhere? 

As it turns out, one way of doing this is by setting global hotkeys in [Alfred.app](http://www.alfredapp.com/) which trigger applescripts to deal with iTunes. Note that these actions are done using applescripts, but if you don't want to have to put ugly shortcuts in your global scripts menu or switch to another app to run the scripts, you need some way of setting a global hotkey. This is where alfred.app comes in, although you need the paid powerpack version to create custom workflows and hotkeys.
